# Oxford-DataAnalyticsAtScale
MSc Social Data Science @ Oxford Uni 2018/2019 - Module Data Analytics at Scale

This project is my summative for the course Data Analytics at Scale. 

The code was used to create an independent research paper with two purposes: 

1. Investigate if there exists any correlation between Airbnb price and distance to museums (all in London). 
2. Demonstrate my ability to improve the performance of code: in this project I used multiprocessing to speed up the calculation of the distance between Airbnbs and Museums in London.

If intereseted in my research paper, please reach out to me.
